# I have defined a function that takes the path, where training subjects' folders are stored, as parameter. This function follows the same 4 prepare data substeps mentioned above. 
# 
# **(step-1)** On _line 8_ I am using `os.listdir` method to read names of all folders stored on path passed to function as parameter. On _line 10-13_ I am defining labels and faces vectors. 
# 
# **(step-2)** After that I traverse through all subjects' folder names and from each subject's folder name on _line 27_ I am extracting the label information. As folder names follow the `sLabel` naming convention so removing the  letter `s` from folder name will give us the label assigned to that subject. 
# 
# **(step-3)** On _line 34_, I read all the images names of of the current subject being traversed and on _line 39-66_ I traverse those images one by one. On _line 53-54_ I am using OpenCV's `imshow(window_title, image)` along with OpenCV's `waitKey(interval)` method to display the current image being traveresed. The `waitKey(interval)` method pauses the code flow for the given interval (milliseconds), I am using it with 100ms interval so that we can view the image window for 100ms. On _line 57_, I detect face from the current image being traversed. 
# 
# **(step-4)** On _line 62-66_, I add the detected face and label to their respective vectors.

# But a function can't do anything unless we call it on some data that it has to prepare, right? Don't worry, I have got data of two beautiful and famous celebrities. I am sure you will recognize them!
# 
# ![training-data](visualization/tom-shahrukh.png)
# 
# Let's call this function on images of these beautiful celebrities to prepare data for training of our Face Recognizer. Below is a simple code to do that.

# In[5]:

#let's first prepare our training data
#data will be in two lists of same size
#one list will contain all the faces
#and other list will contain respective labels for each face
print("Preparing data...")
faces, labels = prepare_training_data("training_data")
print("Data prepared")

#print total faces and labels
print("Total faces: ", len(faces))
print("Total labels: ", len(labels))

# This was probably the boring part, right? Don't worry, the fun stuff is coming up next. It's time to train our own face recognizer so that once trained it can recognize new faces of the persons it was trained on. Read? Ok then let's train our face recognizer. 

# ### Train Face Recognizer

# As we know, OpenCV comes equipped with three face recognizers.
# 
# 1. EigenFace Recognizer: This can be created with `cv2.face.createEigenFaceRecognizer()`
# 2. FisherFace Recognizer: This can be created with `cv2.face.createFisherFaceRecognizer()`
# 3. Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH): This can be created with `cv2.face.LBPHFisherFaceRecognizer()`
# 
# I am going to use LBPH face recognizer but you can use any face recognizer of your choice. No matter which of the OpenCV's face recognizer you use the code will remain the same. You just have to change one line, the face recognizer initialization line given below. 

# In[6]:

#create our LBPH face recognizer 
model = cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create()

#or use EigenFaceRecognizer by replacing above line with 
#face_recognizer = cv2.face.EigenFaceRecognizer_create()

#or use FisherFaceRecognizer by replacing above line with 
#face_recognizer = cv2.face.FisherFaceRecognizer_create()


# Now that we have initialized our face recognizer and we also have prepared our training data, it's time to train the face recognizer. We will do that by calling the `train(faces-vector, labels-vector)` method of face recognizer. 

# In[7]:

#train our face recognizer of our training faces
model.train(faces, np.array(labels))
print("Model Training Complete!!!!!")
